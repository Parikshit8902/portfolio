                Since childhood, Space and Computers have startled me. I look up high in the sky and wonder why! At the same time I look at my computer screen and wonder how! As said by Dr. Richard Feynman, "There is plenty of room at the bottom". Daring to add to this sentence, I would like to say that the top is equally empty too!

                <h3>Embedded Systems have always pushed me to think beyond the box.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The applications of Embedded Systems are vast! There is no domain in the Engineering ecosystem that doesn't involve the use of Systems. They provide a plethora of opportunities to work in the desired domain to an individual. Be it Aerospace, Defence or Space Technology, Embedded Systems find their way into every major industry.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Embedded Systems got me interested, as I can see where my code is going, how it is performing, I can literally hold my code in my hands. When a car paasses by, or a satellite is successfully placed in orbit, or a jumbo-jet is flying by, an Embedded Systems Engineer could proudly say that it has their software running on it. I found it super cool, which fueled my passion for the domain. To fulfil it, I'm constantly looking for learning opportunities. I'm open to opportunities which will help me build knowledge, and upskill me inorder to meet the market requirements, contributing towards development of the society as a whole.</h3>
